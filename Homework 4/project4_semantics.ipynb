For this query, we will go through what the possible meaning representations for the subconstituents of \"flights to boston\" might be. But this is just one way of doing things; other ways are possible, and you should feel free to experiment.\n","\n","Working from bottom up:\n","\n","1. The `TERM_PLACE` phrase \"boston\" uses the composition function template `constant(airports_from_city(' '.join(_RHS)))`, which will be instantiated as `constant(airports_from_city(' '.join(['boston'])))` (recall that `_RHS` is replaced by the right-hand side of the rule). The meaning of `TERM_PLACE` will be the SQL snippet\n","```\n","SELECT airport_service.airport_code \n","FROM airport_service \n","WHERE airport_service.city_code IN\n","    (SELECT city.city_code \n","     FROM city \n","     WHERE city.city_name = \"BOSTON\")\n","```\n","(This query generates a list of all of the airports in Boston.)\n","\n","2. The `N_PLACE` phrase \"boston\" can have the same meaning as the `TERM_PLACE`.\n","\n","3. The `P_PLACE` phrase \"to\" might be associated with a function that maps a SQL query for a list of airports to a SQL condition that holds of flights that go to one of those airports, i.e., `flight.to_airport IN (...)`.\n","\n","4. The `PP_PLACE` phrase \"to boston\" might apply the `P_PLACE` meaning to the `TERM_PLACE` meaning, thus generating a SQL condition that holds of flights that go to one of the Boston airports:\n","```\n","flight.to_airport IN\n","    (SELECT airport_service.airport_code \n","     FROM airport_service \n","     WHERE airport_service.city_code IN\n","         (SELECT city.city_code \n","          FROM city \n","          WHERE city.city_name = \"BOSTON\"))\n","```\n","\n","5. The `PP` phrase \"to Boston\" can again get its meaning from the `PP_PLACE`.\n","\n","6. The `TERM_FLIGHT` phrase \"flights\" might also return a condition on flights, this time the \"null condition\", represented by the SQL truth value `1`. Ditto for the `N_FLIGHT` phrase \"flights\".\n","\n","7. The `N_FLIGHT` phrase \"flights to boston\" can conjoin the two conditions, yielding the SQL condition\n","```\n","flight.to_airport IN\n","    (SELECT airport_service.airport_code \n","     FROM airport_service \n","     WHERE airport_service.city_code IN\n","         (SELECT city.city_code \n","          FROM city \n","          WHERE city.city_name = \"BOSTON\"))\n","AND 1\n","```\n","which can be inherited by the `NOM_FLIGHT` and `NP_FLIGHT` phrases.\n","\n","8. The `S` phrase \"flights to boston\" can use the condition provided by the `NP_FLIGHT` phrase to select all flights satisfying the condition with a SQL query like\n","```\n","SELECT DISTINCT flight.flight_id\n","FROM flight\n","WHERE flight.to_airport IN\n","        (SELECT airport_service.airport_code \n","         FROM airport_service \n","         WHERE airport_service.city_code IN\n","             (SELECT city.city_code \n","              FROM city \n","              WHERE city.city_name = \"BOSTON\"))\n","      AND 1\n","```\n","\n","This SQL query is then taken to be a representation of the meaning for the NL query \"flights to boston\", and can be executed against the ATIS database to retrieve the requested flights."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"0b44a5b8","metadata":{"id":"MlLiq50V2I78"},"source":["Now, it's your turn to add augmentations to `data/grammar` to make this example work.
